# LED-matrix-display-8x8
This is the code and the general description for an LED matrix project I personally have been working in. The project is yet to be completed and I intend to add more to it. The code is amateur-esque as I have near none experience on arduino currently. I was interested in the project and picked up the idea.

# The First semi working project on hardware
<img src = "img/project image3.jpg">
<p>Here one of the columns is dead. This was because of the terrible soldering. I hope to manage it at some point in the coming month</p>

<img src = "img/S test 1.jpg">
<p>This is printing the letter S but since one of the columns is dead along with another one pixel, it looks odd. It should be showing S</p>

## The FINAL working model (showing the character S)
<img src = "img/final project.jpg">
<p>This is the final product after fixing most things. Some of the lEDs are dead and I haven't used resistors, so the life of the LEDs won't be very good. But the project is done!</p>

# The Complete circuit on breadboard
<img src = "img/circuit on breadboard.jpg">
<p>The Circuit looks messy but it was fun to work with! The project was for me to learn about something new and this genuinely satisfies me.</p>
