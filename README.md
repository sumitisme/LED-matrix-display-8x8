# LED-matrix-display-8x8
This is the code and the general description for an LED matrix project I personally have been working in. The project is yet to be completed and I intend to add more to it. The code is amateur-esque as I have near none experience on arduino currently. I was interested in the project and picked up the idea.

# Parts used
* bc547 transistors * 8 (I had initially used 2n2222a but decided to switch since bc547 was cheaper and easier to find)

* 74HC595 Shift resistors * 2
* Breadboard * 2
* Perf board * 1
* Red LEDs * 64
